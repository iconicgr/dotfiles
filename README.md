# dotfiles
Useful dot files for ubuntu/debian bash prompt  
(the files do not work properly on git-bash)

## Quick Intro
The project includes a few . files to be copied in your ~ directory. 

It was created to practice my sh writing skills. 

It's tested on latest ubuntu and debian.

## Functionality
- *Readable bash prompt*: Provides much info without being distracting
- *git*: Provides a clear overview of the local git repository. The feature is disabled for non-git directories.
- *Computer ID*: Quick view of the machine's FQDN or Hostname
- *Computer's main IP*: as it's returned by its routes
- *SSH*: Indication by the prompt to remind you that you are working remotely
- *Useful Aliases*: Provides some commonly used aliases for ls, df etc
- *Disable parts*: By commenting out

## TODO
- Revise the code to be more modular, separate graphics from info
